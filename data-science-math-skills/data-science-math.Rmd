# Course Information

Data Science Math Skills by **Duke University** is a online course you can take on this site  [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/datasciencemathskills).


## Motivation for Learning & Re-learning

A lot of graduate school students struggle with Data Science courses only because of their lack of knowledge and/or understanding of Mathematics for Data Science. The course gives an overview of Mathematical concepts you will encounter while learning Data Science.


## Supplemental Notes and Videos

Here's how I make my notes:

My notes include videos from Khan Academy and other websites. The content's the same, and often a bit better due to lack of errors. The text are usually from the Coursera video transcripts.

I indicate **why** it is important to learn such concepts through **Further Reading** notes.


## Sets and What They're Good For


### Set Basics and Vocabulary

* [Set Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/set-theory/)
* [Set Theory Operations](https://brilliant.org/wiki/set-theory/)


#### Further Reading

> A set is the fundamental discrete structure on which all other discrete structures are built.

Those who studied Discrete Mathematics or read a book about it will probably just re-learn a lot from this course on Set Basics.

* [Applications of Set Theory in Computer Science](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-applications-of-set-theory-in-computer-science/answer/Joshua-Gross-8) - A list of the most obvious applications of Set Theory.
* [Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Kenneth-Rosen/dp/0072899050) - I read most of the book as a supplemental material for a Discrete Math course. The book clearly states why a set is the foundational structure in Computer Science.



### Venn Diagrams

* [What are Venn diagrams?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zt7rk7h/revision)


#### Further Reading

* [A Visual Explanation of SQL Joins](https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/)



## Descartes Was Really Smart

### Plotting Points

* The x-axis is going to be the set of all points x-y in the Cartesian plane, x-y in R2, such that their y coordinate is zero.

* We divide the Cartesian plane into four separate regions, and these we call **quadrants**.

* [Coordinate plane: quadrants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1op92ojA6q0)

### Distance Formula

* [Distance formula](http://www.ccimath.ca/distance-formula.html)


$d = \sqrt{ (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 }$


### Point-Slope Formula for Lines

* [Point Slope Form](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/two-var-linear-equations/point-slope/a/point-slope-form-review)

$y-b=m(x-a)$


### Slope-Intercept Formula

* [Slope Intercept Equation](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/two-var-linear-equations/point-slope/v/point-slope-and-slope-intercept-form-from-two-points)

* [Intro to Slope Intercept Form](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/two-var-linear-equations/slope-intercept-form/a/introduction-to-slope-intercept-form)

$y=mx+b$
